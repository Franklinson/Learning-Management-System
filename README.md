## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview

The Simple LMS is envisioned as a comprehensive web application for managing learning content and student interactions. It will serve two primary user types:

*   **Students**: Can enroll in courses, access lesson materials (text, video, attachments), take interactive quizzes, and monitor their academic progress.
*   **Instructors/Admins**: Have the capability to create new courses, add lessons, design quizzes, and manage existing educational content.
*   **System**: Designed to securely store and manage all essential data, including enrollment records, quiz scores, and student completion progress.

### Core Features

*   **User Authentication**: Secure login and role management (student/instructor).
*   **Course Management**: Create, view, update, and delete courses (title, description, associated instructor).
*   **Lesson Management**: Manage lessons within courses (text content, video links, attachments, display order).
*   **Quiz System**: Develop quizzes with multiple-choice questions, define correct answers, and automate scoring.
*   **Student Enrollment**: Allow students to enroll in available courses.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completed lessons and quiz scores for each student.
*   **Basic Reporting Dashboard**: Overview of student progress per course.

### Future Roadmap (Nice-to-Have Features)

*   Discussion forums for each course.
*   Automated certificates of completion.
*   Advanced search and filtering functionalities for courses.
*   REST API endpoints to support mobile clients.

## 2. Tech Stack

The project leverages a modern and robust set of technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a smooth development experience.

*   **Backend**: Django (Python 3.10+)
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **Frontend**: Django Templating with HTML5 + CSS3 (Bootstrap/Tailwind optional for styling)
*   **Hosting**: Render/Heroku/Railway/Vercel (for simplified deployment)
*   **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

### AI Tools Utilized

*   **Zed, Cursor, Trae**: For AI-assisted coding, refactoring, and general development support.
*   **ChatGPT**: Brainstorming, database schema design, documentation generation, and test planning.
*   **Coderabbit**: Automated code review suggestions to enhance code quality.

## 3. Database Schema (Initial Draft)

The following outlines the initial database schema design, leveraging Django's ORM capabilities for robust data management.

### Users

*   **User** (extends Djangoâ€™s `AbstractUser`)
    *   `role` â†’ `["student", "instructor"]`

### Courses & Lessons

*   **Course**
    *   `title` (string)
    *   `description` (text)
    *   `instructor` (FK to User)

*   **Lesson**
    *   `course` (FK to Course)
    *   `title` (string)
    *   `content` (text/HTML)
    *   `order` (integer)

### Quizzes

*   **Quiz**
    *   `lesson` (FK to Lesson)
    *   `title` (string)

*   **Question**
    *   `quiz` (FK to Quiz)
    *   `text` (text)

*   **Answer**
    *   `question` (FK to Question)
    *   `text` (text)
    *   `is_correct` (boolean)

### Student Progress

*   **Enrollment**
    *   `student` (FK to User)
    *   `course` (FK to Course)
    *   `date_enrolled` (datetime)

*   **LessonProgress**
    *   `enrollment` (FK to Enrollment)
    *   `lesson` (FK to Lesson)
    *   `completed` (boolean)

*   **QuizAttempt**
    *   `student` (FK to User)
    *   `quiz` (FK to Quiz)
    *   `score` (integer)

## 4. Development Strategy

The project will be developed in an agile, phased approach to ensure steady progress and deliver core functionalities early.

*   **Phase 1**: Project setup, basic user roles, Course and Lesson CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
*   **Phase 2**: Implementation of the Quiz system (questions, answers, scoring logic).
*   **Phase 3**: Student Enrollment and progress tracking functionalities.
*   **Phase 4**: Development of the basic reporting dashboard.
*   **Phase 5**: Frontend styling, polishing, and overall user experience enhancements.

## 5. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy is crucial to ensure the reliability and stability of the LMS.

*   **Unit Tests**: Djangoâ€™s `TestCase` will be used for thorough testing of models, views, and forms.
*   **Integration Tests**: Simulate real-world user flows, such as a student enrolling in a course, completing lessons, and taking quizzes.
*   **AI-Assisted Tests**: AI IDEs will be utilized to generate boilerplate test cases, which will then be manually refined and expanded.

**Example AI Prompt for Testing**:
```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
Generate Django unit tests for the QuizAttempt model ensuring score calculation works and multiple attempts are tracked per user.
```

## 6. Documentation & Maintenance

Maintaining high-quality documentation is a priority to ensure project longevity and ease of collaboration.

*   **`README.md`**: This document will be kept as a living document, regularly updated after each feature phase using AI-assisted summaries.

    **Example AI Prompt for README updates**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Summarize the new quiz feature implementation into a changelog format for README.md. Keep it concise.
    ```

*   **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings will be mandatory for all models, views, and utility functions. AI IDEs (Zed/Cursor) will assist in auto-generating these, followed by manual refinement.

    **Example AI Prompt for Docstrings**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Generate Google-style docstrings for the Lesson model in Django. Include fields and relationships.
    ```

*   **Inline Comments**: Short, targeted explanations will be used sparingly for complex logic only, avoiding unnecessary clutter.

    **Example AI Prompt for Inline Comments**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Suggest inline comments for this Django view that calculates student progress, focusing on where the logic might confuse a new developer.
    ```

*   **Coderabbit (AI PR Reviewer)**: Will be configured to review pull requests, suggest refactoring improvements, and enforce coding standards (PEP8, docstring requirements, code readability, and flagging duplicate code).

    **Example Coderabbit setup prompt**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Configure Coderabbit to enforce PEP8, require docstrings for all new functions, and flag duplicate code in views.py.
    ```

## 7. Example AI Prompts Library

A collection of reusable prompts to guide AI tools throughout the project lifecycle.

*   **Schema Design**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Propose a Django model schema for courses, lessons, and quizzes with proper relationships and foreign keys.
    ```
*   **Boilerplate Code**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Generate a Django view for students to enroll in a course, ensuring duplicate enrollments are prevented.
    ```
*   **UI Enhancements**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Suggest simple Bootstrap classes to make the course list view responsive.
    ```
*   **Testing**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Write unit tests for Enrollment model ensuring that a user cannot enroll twice in the same course.
    ```
*   **Refactoring**:
    ```/dev/null/example.md#L1-2
    Refactor this Django view into class-based views while keeping existing functionality intact.
    ```
